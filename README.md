# used-cars-price-prediction
A data mining project where we predicted the prices of used cars using Machine Learning techniques. Machine Learning algorithms like Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost were used and compared to check which yields the highest accuracy. 
I have used 2 datasets in this project.
